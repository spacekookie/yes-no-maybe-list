# wlw yes, no, maybe list

## what is a yes, no, maybe list?

Finding common activities and date ideas can be difficult sometimes, a "yes, no, maybe" list helps finding things everyone involves loves, so one can plan datenights everyone enjoys!

## how can I edit the yes, no, maybe list?

You can use your favorite text editor to either edit the `csv` or `tex` file.

## why should I do this that way?

Since a csv is a machine readable format, it may be fun to parse such lists in python, plot them to graphs with `matplotlib`, or just use `vimdiff` to easily find common activities.
